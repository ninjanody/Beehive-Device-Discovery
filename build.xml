 |  AVAILABLE TARGETS:
 |
 |  This is a project specific build file. The project template is
 |  imported at the beginning of the file which includes common task definitions
 |  and default project targets:
 |
 |    - compile             to compile all Java sources
 |    - unit-test           to execute all Java unit tests
 |    - clean               removes all generated files
 |
 |
 |  CLASSPATHS:
 |
 |  You  can  customize  classpaths  by  editing  the  'java.compile.classpath'  and
 |  'java.test.compile.classpath' paths defined below. Note however that any libraries placed
 |  under project /lib/libraryname-verson and /build/libraryname-version directories will be
 |  automatically added to compiler and runtime execution classpaths. It is recommended that
 |  you use the above-mentioned convention to add libraries unless there's a specific requirement
 |  that doesn't allow you to do so. The project /lib/libraryname-version should be used for
 |  libraries that are runtime dependencies to the project distributable and therefore required
 |  for the project executable to run. The /build/libraryname-version can be used for libraries
 |  that are *only* required at compile time but are *not* required at runtime when the project
 |  executable is run.
 |
 |
 |  EXTENSIONS:
 |
 |  The project template may be extended by adding targets to the
 |  following extensions points:
 |
 |    -before-compile, -after-compile
 |    -before-unit-test-compile, -after-unit-test-compile
 |    -before-unit-test, -after-unit-test
 |
 |  To add individual project targets to default target dependency graphs, create an
 |  extension target such as:
 |
 |    <target name = "verify-results" extensionOf = "-after-unit-test">
 |
 |
 |  Following user defined properties may be set for pre-defined tasks. Add the property
 |  definitions to this build file (or build.properties or local.properties file) according
 |  to the convention:
 |
 |    - Properties with prefix 'unit.test.user' will be passed as system properties to
 |      the unit test JVM

   | Add jars and classes that are required to compile the project here. Note that
