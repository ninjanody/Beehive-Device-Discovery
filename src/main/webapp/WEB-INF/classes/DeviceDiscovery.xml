  Persistence mapping for DeviceDiscovery class.

  To keep the different layers clearly separated (plain domain object layer used for data
  transfer from persistence implementation), utilizing XML based configuration for the domain
  object. Additional persistence configuration is included as annotations in the persistence
  implementation. JPA will combine this XML and annotations as required.

  The only part that requires special handling here is the embedded map collection for device
  attributes. It requires a separate table in the relational schema but to avoid having to split
  the domain object unnecessarily to separate classes we map it using JPA element collection.
